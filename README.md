# Air Quality Analysis

## Project Description
This project analyzes air quality data to identify trends, patterns, and potential pollution sources. The notebook `G1_AirQuality_Analysis.ipynb` includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning modeling to predict air quality levels.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming air quality data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing pollution levels and trends.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Applying machine learning techniques to predict air quality.
- **Results Interpretation**: Analyzing predictions and drawing conclusions.

## Opening the Notebook in Google Colab
To run this notebook in **Google Colab**, follow these steps:

1. Upload `G1_AirQuality_Analysis.ipynb` to your **Google Drive**.
2. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
3. Click **File** > **Open Notebook**.
4. Go to the **Google Drive** tab and select the uploaded notebook.
5. Click **Open** to start working on it.

Alternatively, if the notebook is in a GitHub repository, you can open it directly in Colab using:

```markdown
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-repo-path/G1_AirQuality_Analysis.ipynb)
```
*(Replace `your-repo-path` with the actual GitHub link.)*

## Requirements
Before running the notebook, ensure that all required Python libraries are installed. If needed, install missing dependencies using:

```python
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(If `requirements.txt` is not available, manually install necessary packages in a Colab cell using `!pip install package_name`.)*

## Usage Instructions
- Run the notebook **cell by cell** to execute the steps in order.
- Modify the parameters as needed to customize the analysis.
- Refer to markdown cells for explanations.
